# Analyzing_the_Long_Term_Temperature_Trends_of_the_Varanasi_Region-_A_Study_from_1951_to_2021
Tech Stack: Machine Learning Models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree etc.) 

This study analyses the long-term temperature trends in the Varanasi region over a period spanning
from 1951 to 2021. Utilising daily temperature data, the research investigates variations in
temperature, identifying patterns and trends over seven decades. The study aims to predict future
temperatures by applying various machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Decision
Tree, Random Forest.
The dataset underwent rigorous preprocessing, including the handling of missing values, removal of
duplicates, and identification of outliers. The models were evaluated based on Mean Squared Error
(MSE), R-squared (R²) score, and Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

# Project Strucuture
The project is structured as follows:

Data Collection Methodology:
The dataset used in this study was meticulously collected from the Geophysics Department at Banaras
Hindu University (BHU), a renowned institution well-equipped with the necessary facilities to
conduct extensive climatological research.

Data Cleaning and Optimization: Thorough data wrangling and pre-processing was conducted to ensure high-quality input to the machine learning models.

Data Analysis: Data Analyses by univariate analysis and Bivariate analysis.

Model Building Using Machine Learning: Linear Regression,  Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor.

Evaluation of model: The models were evaluated based on their Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared (R²), Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

# Results

Analyzed temperature data and found a 1.2°C increase in average annual temperatures in the Varanasi region.

Detected significant temperature anomalies, showing a 10% increase in the frequency of extreme temperature events over the 
past 30 years

# Conclusion

The results of this study have important implications for the Varanasi region. Understanding
long-term temperature trends is crucial for local authorities and policymakers to develop effective
climate action plans. The insights gained from this research can help in formulating strategies to
mitigate the adverse effects of climate change and adapt to future climatic conditions.

# Future Work

Building on the insights from this study, several future directions can enhance the understanding
and prediction of long-term temperature trends in the Varanasi region. Firstly, incorporating additional
climatic variables such as humidity, precipitation, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure could
improve the models' accuracy by providing a more comprehensive view of the climate.

Secondly, analysing seasonal variations and trends in maximum and minimum temperatures
separately can offer a deeper understanding of how different times of the year and extreme
temperature events are changing.
